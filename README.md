# Case Study: Augmedix
## Overview and Origin
 ### Augmedix

**Ian Shakil** and **Pelu Tran** founded Augmedix after attending Stanford University in 2012. Ian Shakil was enjoying a park with friends who were employed by Google and were experimenting with a prototype of Google Glass ([Business Inspection BD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvDaS7T63X4), 2023). It inspired him to think about how it could help doctors ([Business Inspection BD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvDaS7T63X4), 2023). Augmedix, established in 2013, went public through a reverse merger in October 2021 ([Reuter](https://medcitynews.com/2020/10/augmedix-goes-public-through-reverse-merger/), 2020) with an IPO of $4 ([Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/augmedix/company_financials
), n.d.). Listed on the Nasdaq exchange as AUGX. Its global headquarters are in San Fransisco, CA with additional offices in Bangladesh and India ([Business Inspection BD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvDaS7T63X4), 2023). Total funding amount in 2023 is 111.7 million USD with nine funding rounds, seven lead investors and twenty-four investors ([Business Inspection BD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvDaS7T63X4), 2023).
## Business Activities
Augmedix strives to solve a pain point for doctors about time spent on patient charting. Clinicians report that up to a third of their time is dedicated to patient charting in various medical settings, impacting the time they can spend with patients and work-life balance ([AUGMEDIX](https://augmedix.com/), n.d.).

Leader Quote:
>“Working on AI at Augmedix is incomparable to anywhere else. There is nothing more fundamental or beautiful about working in AI than in the study of language and how humans communicate. To do so in the context of patient-clinician communication and with the goal of deburdening clinicians is an incredible mission. Furthermore, the strongest asset of AI at Augmedix is its human-first approach.
Our aim is to build AI to support our human scribes because we believe, while machines are great at certain tasks, using machines in conjunction with human expertise will lead to the greatest benefit for our patients.” ([Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1946053472184277&set=a.413554438767529
), n.d.)

The company’s target market is healthcare providers in a range of medical settings from doctor offices to large hospitals. Healthcare services globally were $7,975.87 billion in 2023 ([Globe Newswire](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/healthcare-services-global-market-report-134400283.html), 2023). This is a considerable large market for Augmedix products.

## Products:
Augmedix AI enabled product offerings were initially available through Google Glass using AI but has progressed to offering service on mobile devices too. Augmedix announced in December 2023 that it is now using Google’s Med-PaLM 2 and is integrating Google Cloud’s MedLM technology into its stack in addition to its own AI build ([AUGMEDIX](https://augmedix.com/resources/news/augmedix-partners-with-google-cloud-to-bring-medically-tuned-ai-technology-to-ambient-documentation/), 2023).

According to Augmedix’s website, Augmedix Go is a mobile app that uses ambient AI technology and structured data to capture and automate a draft medical note after a patient visit ([AUGMEDIX](https://augmedix.com/resources/news/augmedix-partners-with-google-cloud-to-bring-medically-tuned-ai-technology-to-ambient-documentation/), n.d.). The note is available in the electronic health record for the clinician to review and sign off ([AUGMEDIX](https://augmedix.com/products/ ), n.d.).

Augmedix Live is AI-enabled synchronous medical documentation and point-of-care support to save up to 3 hours per day for the clinician, increase productivity, and improve Work-Life balance. It enables two-way communication with a trained medical documentation specialist. The product is HIPAA-compliant technology ([AUGMEDIX](https://augmedix.com/products/ ), n.d.).

Augmedix Notes offers AI-enabled asynchronous medical notes using AI technology ([AUGMEDIX](https://augmedix.com/products/ ), n.d.). The medical device records interactions between the clinician and patient during the medical appointment ([AUGMEDIX](https://augmedix.com/products/ ), n.d.). The medical notes are automatically uploaded into the electronic health record after the appointment ([AUGMEDIX](https://augmedix.com/products/ ), n.d.). This product offers communication with a medical documentation specialist if needed by the clinician. This product uses HIPAA-compliant technology ([AUGMEDIX](https://augmedix.com/products/ ), n.d.).

Augmedix Prep is AI-enabled chart preparation before a patient appointment ([AUGMEDIX](https://augmedix.com/products/ ), n.d.). It utilizes the Notebuilder platform for chart preparation before a patient appointment (AUGMEDIX, n.d.). A medical documentation specialist reviews the chart ([AUGMEDIX](https://augmedix.com/products/ ), n.d.). It is unclear from the Augmedix product description website if the patient is providing information online before the visit or data is input into the system by an office clerk before the visit.
## Landscape
Augmedix has several healthcare services competitors worldwide. A few of the competitors are Abridge, Aquity Solutions, Robin Healthcare, Valhalla Healthcare, DeepScribe, ScribeAmerica, Suki, Abstractive Health, Nabla, Mutuo Health Solutions, Amazon Transcribe Medical, and DeepCura AI ([G<sup>2</sup>](https://www.g2.com/products/augmedix/competitors/alternatives), n.d.) ([CBInsights](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/augmedix/alternatives-competitors), n.d.).

Augmedix has the advantage of offering medical AI charting services longer than several of the above companies. It also offers a competitive advantage in its combination of AI and trained medical scribes with Google glass or a mobile unit which offer more accurate and efficient charting abilities versus companies that only rely on AI systems.

Over the next 10 years, the healthcare industry will embrace data strategy and leverage more advanced analytics and AI to improve patient outcomes and lower healthcare costs but will need to choose when to use AI regarding ethics and regulatory requirements ([WestMonroe](https://www.westmonroe.com/perspectives/report/healthcare-outlook?atrkid=V3ADWED098667_142679836515_kwd-333354911644__685515623984_g_c___&gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-7ynq7yEhQMVwltHAR3c-g8JEAAYAyAAEgJo2PD_BwE), 2023). The healthcare industry continues to experience labor shortages, however, if innovative technologies like AI, machine learning, and predictive analytics are implemented, it might lessen the impact of healthcare labor shortages due to increase in worker efficiency ([WestMonroe](https://www.westmonroe.com/perspectives/report/healthcare-outlook?atrkid=V3ADWED098667_142679836515_kwd-333354911644__685515623984_g_c___&gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-7ynq7yEhQMVwltHAR3c-g8JEAAYAyAAEgJo2PD_BwE), 2023). Mergers and acquisitions are likely to continue, along with acquisitions by private equity firms ([WestMonroe](https://www.westmonroe.com/perspectives/report/healthcare-outlook?atrkid=V3ADWED098667_142679836515_kwd-333354911644__685515623984_g_c___&gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-7ynq7yEhQMVwltHAR3c-g8JEAAYAyAAEgJo2PD_BwE), 2023). It is possible that Augmedix could merge with another company in the future too.
## Results
Augmedix has made an impact by offering products ameliorating a common pain point for clinicians in charting documentation. Based on testimonials and case studies Augmedix seems to increase efficiency for physicians allowing them to provide more patient care and better work-life balance. Measures of success are time saved, accuracy of documentation, and excellent job satisfaction ([AUGMEDIX](https://augmedix.com/), n.d.). 
## Recommendations
Augmedix should expand its services by using predictive analytics on top of its AI capabilities. Predictive analytics could provide insight into patient health, find patterns in charts and alert practitioners to potential negative outcomes developing for patients. AI and predictive analytics together offer suggestions to physicians of tests, treatments, and vaccinations to consider for the best outcome for patient.
